## Introduce

**PuSH** in Bash scripting language.
As the name suggests, it is a library for the Bash scripting language designed to enhance programming with Bash by customizing inputs and outputs, providing an easier-to-use interface on the Linux terminal.

The idea behind the name 'PuSH' is to push Bash programming to be more powerful and easier to use. Additionally, both **PuSH** and **Bash** end with **sh**, reflecting the file type of Bash scripts.

PuSH is designed to be used in bigger Bash scripts as a library or extension, enhancing the script's interface and making it more user-friendly in a simpler way.
